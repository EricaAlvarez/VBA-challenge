**# VBA CHALLENGE**

  **Description:**
  
    The reason for this code creation is the beginning of my journey learning to code.
  
  **Challenge assignment:**
  
    This code pertains to Module 02, which focuses on VBA coding in Excel.
    
  **Application:**
  
    The application summarizes the changes in price behavior and volume storage for various tickers throughout the year, where the relevant information is the following: the ticker name, the date, and the prices (the open price and close price).
        
  **Instructions to use:**
  
  To ensure proper code usage, it is necessary to have the required information stored in an Excel sheet. The initial step is to ensure the column is as follows: ticker, date, open, high, low, close, and volume. Additionally, it is essential to start storing data from cell "A2" in alphabetical order.
  
  **Learning:**
  
    I've learned much more besides the VBA language throughout the last classes and tutor sessions. For example, I'm learning how to write with order and clarity to find a specific part inside the code and make changes; I've also learned to track errors in my code to correct them.
